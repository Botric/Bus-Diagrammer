# Bus Scheduling System - Implemented Fixes Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED: SRT Database Implementation

### Problem Fixed
The original system was calculating all inter-station travel times as uniform 17-minute segments, regardless of actual timetable data. This led to inaccurate routing and scheduling decisions.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced Run Data Structure**: Added `stop_times` field to the `Run` dataclass to capture individual stop timing data
2. **Advanced SRT Database**: Created persistent storage system that:
   - Parses actual stop times from CSV/Excel bulk paste data
   - Calculates real travel durations between consecutive stops
   - Stores higher travel times when newer timetables are input
   - Persists data to `srt_database.json` for future use

### How It Works
1. **Data Input**: When using bulk paste (CSV/Excel format), the system now captures:
   ```
   Stop,Service 1,Service 2
   Town Centre,08:00,09:30
   Shopping Mall,08:15,09:45
   Hospital,08:25,09:55
   ```

2. **Time Calculation**: Instead of uniform 17-min segments:
   - Town Centre â†’ Shopping Mall = 15 minutes (08:00 to 08:15)
   - Shopping Mall â†’ Hospital = 10 minutes (08:15 to 08:25)
   - Uses actual timetable data for accurate routing

3. **Persistence**: All calculated times stored in JSON database:
   ```json
   {
     "town centre|shopping mall": {
       "duration_minutes": 15,
       "last_updated": "2025-07-29T..."
     }
   }
   ```

## âœ… COMPLETED: Improved Alternate Routing Logic

### Problem Fixed
The original alternate routing only checked if a bus was available at run start time, but didn't account for travel time needed to get from the end of one run to the start of another.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Travel Time Calculation**: New `calculate_travel_time_between_runs()` function that:
   - Looks up actual travel time between end station of last run and start station of next run
   - Returns 0 minutes if runs connect directly (same terminus)
   - Uses SRT database for accurate travel times
   - Falls back to 15-minute default for unknown routes

2. **Enhanced Scheduling Algorithm**: Updated `schedule_buses()` to:
   - Calculate total transition time = layover + travel time
   - Use maximum of terminal-specific layover or actual travel time
   - Account for deadheading time in bus availability calculations

### Example Improvement
**Before**: Bus finishes at Hospital 10:10, next run starts at Railway Station 11:00
- System assumed: 15-minute layover = bus available at 10:25
- Bus assigned even though travel time Hospitalâ†’Railway Station = 25 minutes

**After**: Same scenario
- System calculates: 25 minutes travel time + terminal layover
- Bus correctly marked unavailable until 10:35 (or later with layover)
- More realistic scheduling with proper bus utilization

## âœ… COMPLETED: Features Available

### 1. SRT Database Statistics
- Visit `/srt-stats` to view:
  - Total route segments tracked
  - All known stations
  - Sample travel times with last update dates
  - Database statistics

### 2. Accurate Timing from Bulk Paste 
- Paste CSV/Excel data with stop names and times
- System automatically captures individual stop times
- Calculates precise segment durations
- Updates persistent database

### 3. Improved Bus Assignment
- Considers actual travel time between runs
- Uses terminal-specific layover settings
- Prevents impossible bus transitions
- Optimizes for realistic operations

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `app.py`: Enhanced Run dataclass, routing logic, SRT integration
- `templates/index.html`: Updated bulk paste to capture stop times
- `templates/configure.html`: Pass through stop times data
- `templates/srt_stats.html`: New statistics page
- `srt_database.py`: Complete SRT database implementation

### Database Structure
```python
@dataclass
class SRTEntry:
    from_station: str
    to_station: str  
    duration_minutes: int
    last_updated: str  # ISO timestamp
```

### Key Functions Added
- `calculate_travel_time_between_runs()`: Real travel time calculation
- `update_srt_from_runs()`: Update database from timetable input
- `_update_from_timetable()`: Parse stop times for accurate segments
- SRT database persistence and statistics methods

## ðŸ“Š Testing & Validation

### Sample Test Data
Use the provided sample CSV files:
- `sample_inbound.csv`: Inbound services with real timing
- `sample_outbound.csv`: Outbound services with real timing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open http://localhost:5620
2. Paste sample CSV data using bulk paste buttons
3. Generate schedule and observe:
   - Actual travel times used (not uniform 17 minutes)
   - Realistic bus transitions
   - SRT database populated with real data
4. Check `/srt-stats` for database contents

## ðŸŽ¯ Results Achieved

### Accuracy Improvements
- âœ… Real timetable data used instead of uniform estimates
- âœ… Persistent learning from multiple timetable inputs
- âœ… Accurate bus transition timing
- âœ… Proper accounting for deadheading between terminals

### System Robustness
- âœ… Graceful fallback when timing data unavailable
- âœ… Persistent database survives application restarts
- âœ… Higher travel times kept when multiple timetables input
- âœ… Statistics and monitoring capabilities

The bus scheduling system now provides significantly more accurate and realistic scheduling by using actual timetable data and properly accounting for bus travel times between runs.
